        <p class="para">I like to draw on an app called Procreate. You can use layers, colors, shapes, and brushes to create many different designs. Currently, I'm working on holiday cards for my friends. Art uses the right hemisphere which doesn't get used very much if you're a person like me who does coding and reading and math.
